      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          A superspreader event (SSE) is an incident in which a single infected
          individual transmits a contagious disease (in this case COVID-19) to a
          much larger number of people than the average transmission rate.
          Factors such as close contact, large crowds, and prolonged exposure
          can contribute to an event becoming a superspreader.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, events like weddings, religious
          services, and political rallies often led to spikes in cases. In this
          project, we analyze how political SSEs uniquely contributed to the
          spread of COVID-19, with a focus on their dynamics and consequences.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="problem-definition">
        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to model the spread of COVID-19 at political rallies and
          compare it to other types of SSEs. Using ARIMA and SEIR models, we
          will determine whether political events exhibit unique characteristics
          that amplify disease transmission.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="literature-survey">
        <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
        <p>
          Superspreader events have long influenced pandemic dynamics. Existing
          literature highlights their significance in accelerating transmission
          but often lacks specificity regarding political rallies. Our survey
          synthesizes insights from key studies and identifies gaps we aim to
          address.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Papers like Kumar et al. (2020) and
            Stein (2011) provide foundational insights into SSE dynamics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Limited definitions of SSEs and
            retrospective analyses hinder proactive prevention.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="proposed-method">
        <h2>Proposed Method</h2>
        <h3>Intuition</h3>
        <p>
          We hypothesize that political rallies exhibit unique transmission
          patterns due to crowd behavior and ideology-driven non-compliance with
          safety protocols.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Data from reliable sources like the Crowd Counting Consortium and NYT
          COVID-19 dataset will be analyzed using ARIMA and SEIR models. Our
          findings will be visualized to identify trends and correlations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="experiments">
        <h2>Experiments</h2>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do political rallies differ significantly from other SSEs in disease
            spread?
          </li>
          <li>
            How do different political affiliations impact the dynamics of
            transmission?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Experiment Details</h3>
        <p>
          Using ARIMA for time-series forecasting and SEIR for epidemiological
          modeling, we aim to correlate event characteristics with case spikes.
          Visualizations will compare infection dynamics across event types.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Our analysis aims to clarify the role of political SSEs in the
          COVID-19 pandemic, providing insights to inform future public health
          strategies. Limitations include model imperfection and data
          availability, but our findings will lay groundwork for further
          research.
