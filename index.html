      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          A superspreader event (SSE) is an incident in which a single infected
          individual transmits a contagious disease (in this case COVID-19) to a
          much larger number of people than the average transmission rate.
          Factors such as close contact, large crowds, and prolonged exposure
          can contribute to an event becoming a superspreader.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, events like weddings, religious
          services, and political rallies often led to spikes in cases. In this
          project, we analyze how political SSEs uniquely contributed to the
          spread of COVID-19, with a focus on their dynamics and consequences.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="problem-definition">
        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
        <p>
We aimed to model the spread of COVID-19 at political rallies and compare it to other types of SSEs. Using SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables) and SEIR models, we determined whether political events of a specific valence exhibited unique characteristics that amplified disease transmission.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="literature-survey">
        <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
        <p>
          Superspreader events have long influenced pandemic dynamics. Existing
          literature highlights their significance in accelerating transmission
          but often lacks specificity regarding political rallies. Our survey
          synthesizes insights from key studies and identifies gaps we aim to
          address.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Papers like Kumar et al. (2020) and
            Stein (2011) provide foundational insights into SSE dynamics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Limited definitions of SSEs and
            retrospective analyses hinder proactive prevention.

      <section id="proposed-method">
        <h2>Proposed Method</h2>
        <h3>Intuition</h3>
        <p>
          We hypothesize that political rallies exhibit unique transmission
          patterns due to crowd behavior and ideology-driven non-compliance with
          safety protocols.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Data from reliable sources like the Crowd Counting Consortium and NYT
          COVID-19 dataset will be analyzed using ARIMA and SEIR models. Our
          findings will be visualized to identify trends and correlations.
        </p>

      <section id="experiments">
        <h2>Experiments</h2>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do political rallies differ significantly from other SSEs in disease
            spread?
          </li>
          <li>
            How do different political affiliations impact the dynamics of
            transmission?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Experiment Details</h3>
        <p>
          Using ARIMA for time-series forecasting and SEIR for epidemiological
          modeling, we aim to correlate event characteristics with case spikes.
          Visualizations will compare infection dynamics across event types.

      <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          We found two telling results from our outputs: first, that any given
          event didn't have that much of an effect on causing huge spikes, and
          second, comparing all events shows that Republican ones were indeed
          the most likely to spread Covid, followed by control events and then
          Democratic events. Figure 3 above is from Los Angeles County in
          California and shows that the predicted cases where the exogenous
          variable is equal to 2 (Republican-leaning events in our dataset) are
          higher than both where valence is 0 (no political leanings) and where
          valence is 1 (Democratic-leaning). This supports our initial
          hypothesis that Republican-leaning events would be more likely to
          spread the disease. Still, it was a little surprising how much lower
          the projected Democratic-leaning spread was even compared to the
          projected control spread. This follows a general conclusion that
          ignoring safe disease practices leads to a greater spread of the
          disease.

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The findings of this study show a straightforward but important point:
          those who did not follow expert recommendations in regards to the
          pandemic and public health likely contributed the most to increased
          case counts. Our results suggest that no single event was a major
          driver of significant spikes in case counts. Itâ€™s likely that each
          event contributed incrementally, compounding the case counts over
          time. The process of analysis presented several challenges,
          particularly in working with the datasets. For instance, the valence
          variable had to be recoded to properly differentiate between the
          effects of different political events as an exogenous variable in the
          ARIMA model. The COVID-19 case data was incomplete, with dates showing
          zero case counts. To address this, we applied data cleaning and
          imputation strategies to interpolate missing values, aiming to produce
          more realistic projections. Another complexity was tuning the ARIMA
          model. The various underlying mechanisms of COVID made it challenging
          to select parameters that captured the full dynamics of the data, so
          model optimization took longer than expected. Looking ahead, we aim to
          expand our analysis to include a broader set of counties, as time
          constraints limited us to a subset of the 1,736 counties available. We
          also plan to explore alternative models to validate whether our
          conclusions remain consistent across different methodologies. By
          refining both our approach and the data, we hope to gain deeper
          insights into the relationships between political events, public
          health behaviors, and disease spread.
